class GaussianSplatReconstruction:
    """
    Engine for reconstructing a Gaussian splat radiance field from posed images in an :class:`~fvdb_reality_capture.sfm_scene.sfm_scene.SfmScene`.

    This class implements the reconstruction algorithm using a :class:`fvdb.GaussianSplat3d` model and a differentiable rendering pipeline.

    The reconstruction process optimizes the parameters of the Gaussian splats to minimize the difference between rendered images and the input images.
    The optimization process can be configured using a :class:`GaussianSplatReconstructionConfig` instance, and the underlying
    :class:`fvdb.GaussianSplat3d` model can be customized as well.

    The reconstruction can also optionally optimize camera poses if they are not accurate, using a simple pose adjustment model which stores a per-camera
    embedding which is decoded into a small change in rotation and translation for each camera.

    To create a :class:`GaussianSplatReconstruction` instance, use the :meth:`from_sfm_scene` class method, which initializes the model and optimizer
    from an :class:`~fvdb_reality_capture.sfm_scene.sfm_scene.SfmScene` and a :class:`GaussianSplatReconstructionConfig`.

    You can configure logging and checkpointing during optimization process using an instance of :class:`~fvdb_reality_capture.radiance_fields.GaussianSplatReconstructionBaseWriter`.
    By default, this class uses a :class:`~fvdb_reality_capture.radiance_fields.GaussianSplatReconstructionWriter` which logs metrics, images, and checkpoints to a directory.

    You can also visualize the optimization process using an optional :class:`fvdb.viz.Scene` instance, which can display
    the current state of the Gaussian splat radiance field interactively in a web browser or notebook.

    The reconstruction process is started by calling the :meth:`reconstruct` method, which runs the optimization loop.

    To get the reconstructed model, use the :meth:`model` attribute, which is a :class:`fvdb.GaussianSplat3d` instance.

    You can also get a dictionary of metadata about the reconstruction using the :meth:`reconstruction_metadata` attribute.
    This metadata is useful for downstream tasks such as extracting meshes or exporting to USDZ.

    The state of the reconstruction can be saved and loaded using the :meth:`state_dict` and :meth:`from_state_dict` methods.
    These methods allow you to pause and resume reconstructions from checkpoints.
